# Bitcoin price chart with Quandl API integration 

Useful (i hope!) way of charting Bitcoin price of BITSTAMP exchange using QUANDL API integration  and some easy statistics, it could be the starting point for others calculations and some basic long term trading 
## WHY?

Practising on real financial data without having the need to buy and to code a personal API to the brokerage, download and convert CSV etc, my example works on other financial instruments, you have only to check and to rename columns 


### Prerequisites and other infos 

R installed, if u miss one or more packages i've wrote the command commented in the code  
If you want to pull many requests from QUANDL you have to register for a free api key http://www.quandl.com 
If you want to dig deeper in charting with R check the quantmod website https://www.quantmod.com/
